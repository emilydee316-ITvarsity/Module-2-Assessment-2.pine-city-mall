                    <h3>GAME</h3>
                    <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p>Game is a UK-based video game retailer, previously a subsidiary of publicly traded Game Digital, but wholly owned by the Frasers Group since June 2019.
The company's origins lie in the founding of the Rhino Group by Terry Norris and Bev Ripley in 1992. A number of mergers and acquisitions followed during the 1990s, and in 1999, the company was purchased by Electronics Boutique Limited, which rebranded itself as The Game Group. The company continued to expand during the 2000s, purchasing several retailers including Gameswizards in Australia.
 In March 2012, several suppliers, including Nintendo, Electronic Arts and Capcom refused to supply their latest products due to concerns over Game's creditworthiness. Game subsequently entered administration on 26 March 2012, and was purchased by OpCapita the following week. Baker Acquisitions was subsequently renamed Game Retail Ltd.</p>

<p>The company operated in the United Kingdom under the GAME and Gamestation brands from the acquisition of the latter in May 2007 until the end of 2012, when it was announced that the business would focus solely on the Game brand.[citation needed]
GAME Digital plc reported a £10.4 million loss for the 12-month period from July 2016 to July 2017 in its full year results. In the corresponding 2015–2016 period, the company had a net profit of £7.1 million.
In June 2019, Game Digital agreed to a takeover of the company by Frasers Group for £52 million</p>
